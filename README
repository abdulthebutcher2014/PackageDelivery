Delivery package project

This is a rudimentary project that can be used to track package delivery.

There are many things that are involved in package delivery that are not accounted 
in this application. My hope was to stub some attributes and give a good idea on 
how to track packages. 

My focus first was to set up user access.

I want to create a user id of admin with password admin so you can log in after
starting the application for first time. You are then forced to change the admin 
password. Other id's can be added and an admin can promote the id to admin.

All deliveries are from Lincoln NE.

All deliveries are direct.

Locations and distances from Lincoln can be added.

Shippers and consignees must be registered.

I wasn't able to set up e-mail.

However I did submit the tracking to a log. (see delivery.log.) 

The all deliveries view should have completed deliveries removed.

Time stamps should be on the deliveries.

There could be many improvements.
